# Making animated stickers under 500KB for iMessage

With the release of iOS 10, Apple introduced stickers in iMessage. A sticker is
a small image or animation that can be sent or placed on messages, photos or on
other stickers.

Creating a sticker pack with your own animated stickers is simple! You need an
**animated PNG** and **Xcode 8**.
Clone this project to get started, watch Apple's
[video tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tutorials/building-sticker-packs/),
or follow the steps below.

Keeping **animated stickers below the maximum size of 500KB** can be
challenging. We'll show you how you can use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) to accomplish this! **Read on!**

## Creating an iMessage Sticker Pack Application

First create a new Sticker Pack Application in Xcode 8. Select *File* > *New* >
*Project* from the menu, then choose *Sticker Pack Application*.

Name your project and choose a location to save it.

## Adding an animated PNG to your Sticker Pack

Your project is empty after creation. If you already have an animated PNG, you
can drag and drop it to the sticker pack under *Stickers.xcstickers* > *Sticker
Pack*.

For optimal performance, Apple has added a hard **file size limit of 500KB**
for stickers. Xcode will warn you when you attempt to add a file that is larger.

Making sure your stickers are below 500KB can be especially challenging for
animated stickers! Luckily you can use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) to compress your stickers.

## Compressing animated PNGs with TinyPNG

You can compress your images in order to reduce the file size. With the
[TinyPNG website you can compress (animated) PNGs for free](https://tinypng.com).
This allows you squeeze every last byte out of your images and to create the
best possible stickers!

## Compare before & after

[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) uses advanced techniques to compress images. The differences is barely
noticeable. Yet this image of a waving panda is compressed from 1.5MB to 492 KB.
You can see there is barely a visible difference.

**Note that animated PNGs are only displayed in Firefox or Safari. In other
browsers you only see the first frame.**

Original animated PNG – 1.5MB | Optimised animated PNG – 492KB

## How to reduce file size further?

If the [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) service is not able to compress your animated PNG below 500KB,
you might have to take other steps to reduce the file size. You may have to
change your image so that the dimensions are smaller, or use fewer frames.
